# CSCI 2910 Lab 4 - WeatherBuddy

This repository contains the implementation of **WeatherBuddy**, a Python application that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to display current weather and 5-day forecasts for user-specified cities. Features include saving favorite cities and an ASCII chart for temperature trends.

## Issues
- 2025-09-29: Got 401 Unauthorized — fixed by regenerating API key and reloading env.
- 2025-09-30: Timeout on school Wi-Fi — resolved after network login; increased timeout to 10s.
